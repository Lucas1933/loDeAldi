# LoDeAldi

I wanted to create a Single Page Application (SPA) using only JavaScript. The results are not bad, but the code structure (or lack of it) indicates that it was my first attempt at writing something interesting with JavaScript.

An improved (and in progress) version of this website can be found in this repository: [Lo De Aldi!](https://github.com/Lucas1933/LoDeAldi-FrontEnd).

The deploy of this first version: [Lo De Aldi! Vanilla JavaScript SPA](https://scintillating-yeot-d720f3.netlify.app/)

The deploy of the current version been work on: [Lo De Aldi! Full Stack App](https://lodealdi.com.ar/)
