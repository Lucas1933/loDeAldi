# LoDeAldi

I set out to create a Single Page Application (SPA) using only JavaScript. While the results are promising, it's evident that this project represents my initial foray into developing something engaging with JavaScript.

For an improved and ongoing version of this website, please visit this repository: [Lo De Aldi!](https://github.com/Lucas1933/LoDeAldi-FrontEnd).
